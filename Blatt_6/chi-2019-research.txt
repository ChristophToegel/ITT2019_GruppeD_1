VelociWatch

VelociWatch tackles the problem of auto correcting algorithms changing the users
desired input on the extrem for factor of a smart watch display. Testing the option
to lock letters from predictions and simplifying the keyboard for smart watches led
to the keyboard design with prediction slots and a literal field. Low error rates
were examined over a variety of tests, while users preferred typing over swiping keys.
The study shows simplicity and correction methods for text inputs.

RotoSwype

RotoSwype presents a new way of using rotation for text entry. Th Users wears a ring
which translates rotation into moving a cursor on a keyboard. With the click of a button
on the ring a key is pressed or letters get deleted. Users report problems with 
clicking the button while maintaining precise selection of keys

RayCursor

RayCursor extends the commonly used RayTracing pointing technique by adding a cursor along
the ray. Methods like filtering and highlighting closest allow for a more precise pointing
method. The hardware consists of a HTC vive Controller and its touchpad for moving the 
cursor along the ray. This method allows for new selection and manipulating techniques 
previous raytracing wasn't able to provide.
