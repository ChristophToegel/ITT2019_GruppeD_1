First Question

Indirect pointing devices make interaction on very big or small screens easier.
Selections and traversing display areas with translated mouse movement, scaling
from the same pointing device movements, are much more efficient than constant 
pointer speeds. This is an advantage of indirect pointing devices.

On a big presentation screen a direct pointing device would make no sense. 
As screens get to big, humans can't interact directly with the whole screen
or display anymore and therefore a relative pointing device is needed for translating
ones physical bodily motions for use on the bigger display.

Second Question

Shift uses direct input, as the interaction still takes place at the original
position and Shift only creates a copy of it for better visual representation 
(only when a callout is created) (Vogel & Baudisch, 2007, p. 2).	
Relative movement is used as interactions can be slowed down up to an 8:1 ratio
(Vogel & Baudisch, 2007, p. 9), but other than that its aboslute movement.
Shift is an isotonic device as well as an position controlled one, as it is based
on a touch screen ("Pointing device", 2019).
Inputs are made by translating, as a finger gets moved across the screen in a 
2 dimensional space, resulting in 2 degrees of freedom (Vogel & Baudisch, 2007).

Third Question
The device has a screen size  of 550 Ã— 730mm with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels
as pointed out in section "Apparatus" (Vogel & Baudisch, 2007, p. 7)
