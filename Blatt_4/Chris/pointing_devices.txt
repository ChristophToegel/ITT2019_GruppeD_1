First Question

Indirect pointing devices make interaction on very big or small screens easier.
Selections and traversing display areas with translated mouse movement, scaling
from the same pointing device movements, are much more efficient than constant 
pointer speeds. This is an advantage of indirect pointing devices.

On a big presentation screen a direct pointing device would make no sense. 
As screens get to big, humans can't interact directly with the whole screen
or display are and therefore a relative pointing device is need translating one
motion for use on the way bigger display.

Second Question

Shift uses direct input, as the interaction still takes place at the original
position and Shift only creates a copy of it for better visual representation 
(only when a callout is created) (Vogel & Baudisch, 2007, p. 2).	
Relative movement is used as interactions can be slowed down up to an 8:1 ratio
(Vogel & Baudisch, 2007, p. 9). Shift is an isotonic device as well as an position
controlled one, as are all touch screens ("Pointing device", 2019).
Inputs are made by translating, as a finger gets moved across the screen in a 
2 dimensional space, resulting in 2 degrees of freedom (Vogel & Baudisch, 2007).
