First Question
Horbæk references 2 studies that show no correlation between user-reported results and
objectively recorded data (Hornbæk, 2011, 35). This stems from usability being a multidimensional
scale and the 2 reported data types measure different dimensions (Hornbæk, 2011, p. 35-36).
Features we objectively apply to software or user experienced products may not be 
perceived the same way we want to record them with objective measures.

Second Question
Hornbæk talks about the effect, that using hypotheses before conducting the experiment, 
will lead to biased results, as examiners will try to find the sought after outcome (Hornbæk, 2011, p. 13).
To the contrary formulating hypotheses beforehand clarifies research goals and validates them
as hypotheses "must be (a) testable, (b) concise and (c) name key constructs" (Hornbæk, 2011, p. 14).
This also allows for easier understanding of the paper by readers.

Third Question
It depends on your study and it's design. Media informatics students are a specific group 
and can differ from other groups or the general population. But this applies to all students 
(Hornbæk, 2011,  p. 27).
The study has to factor in whether the characteristics of the selected group of
participants will have an effect on the recorded data and study outcomes. This might be through 
knowledge of the subject or environments, social status, level of education.


An example where using media informatics students as participants might effect results is:
Effectiveness of usage of english or german user interfaces, as students often have better
english language skills as the general population and media informatics students in particular
are familiar with english user interfaces.

A counter example, where it most likely won't have an effect on outcome would be:
Studying reaction times to pre-attentively or attentively processed stimuli, as they
mostly are triggered by subconcious mental processes.
