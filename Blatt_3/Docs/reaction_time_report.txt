The experiment was overall successful.
All participants took similar positions in front of the used computer,
although some changed their hand positioning during the task.

As all 4 participants were in the same room at the beginning, 
the instructions were only once read out aloud.

It seemed as if matching the button "R" to "red" and "even" and 
"U" to "blue" and "odd" was slowing down reaction times.
